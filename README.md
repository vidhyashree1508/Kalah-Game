The Kalah game is conceptually very simple, but is strategy based. The strategy of the Kalah Game can be very challenging. This very aspect makes it well suited for the analysis of the Min-Max AB and Alpha Beta Search algorithms. In this project, we deal with the different ways we could create a computer to computer Kalah game. We have based the game on MinMax-AB and Alpha-Beta Search algorithm and are trying to see which one yields better results. We have used three evaluation functions to get a better approximation of the values for the players that could be used to predict further moves. We use two depths, 2 and 4 and three evaluation functions. We mark the results from each of the combinations of the search algorithm, depth and evaluation function and draw conclusions about the performance of each algorithm. The results will be tabulated and presented for better understanding.
